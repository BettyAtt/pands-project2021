## About the Project:
This project analyses the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set [1] using Python [2]. This repository documents the researching of the data set, the documentation, and the code (in Python) used to investigate it.  
This project forms part of the coursework required for the module Programming & Scripting, a core module of GMIT's Higher Diploma of Computer Science in Data Analytics.

# Introduction  

Fisher's Iris dataset is well known because it provides a manageably small but robust enough real world multivariagate dataset [3]. This is ideal for use in a wide scope of problem solving scenarios including statistical analysis, statistical graphics, multivariate statistics and machine learning [4].  

Ronald Aylmer Fisher, later knighted for his work in statistics [3], wrote a paper in 1936 in which the Iris dataset first appears titled "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems" [5]. The dataset is a balanced dataset consisting of 150 samples. It is considered a balanced dataset because it breaks down into 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (*Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica*) [5].  

The data was used by Fisher with permission by Dr Edgar Anderson, who picked and measured two of the three species on the Gaspé Peninsula in Canada. The data Dr Anderson collected for each sample included sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, and petal width in cm [5]. In the article [5], Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate between Iris species based on these four measurements [3].

Fisher's Iris dataset is an ideal starting point for learning data mining techniques. Data mining is digging through data to look for connections and predict trends. SAS notes data mining is a culmination of "three intertwined scientific disciplines: statistics (the numeric study of data relationships), artificial intelligence (human-like intelligence displayed by software and/or machines) and machine learning (algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions)" [7]. Machine Learning is a popular area of use as the dataset is ideal for teaching beginners principles of machine learning as well as serving as an ideal test for new sorting and classifying methods. It is so commonly used that the machine learning library for Python Scikit-Learn (sk-learn) includes it as one of the loadable datasets. The dataset is also freely available for download and use from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository [1]. UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository enumerates the many published papers that reference this dataset showing the wide range of domains it is used in especially in the domains of computer science and statistics [1].
